            <p>First, how was your last holiday? Did you spend any time in nature? Shut your eyes and see if you can recall how you feel about the last time you spent time in nature. What about your normal busy day away from stunning views, beaches and sunsets? Does your daily routine give you any experiences of nature? Perhaps you don't have the time to notice the birds calling, the bees buzzing and to enjoy the colours of the changing seasons in a local park, even in your own street. If you're not getting enough nature you're not alone.</p>
              <p className='border-left ps-5'>
                <span className=" text-success h3">"Green" </span>refers to a world in which natural resources, including oceans, land, and forests, are sustainably managed and conserved to improve livelihoods and ensure food security. It's a world in which healthy ecosystems increase all the economic returns from the activities they support.
              </p>
              <p>
              More than ever, it's imperative to implement any and all sustainable methods possible to create a healthier future and protect the environment and green living could be the way to do that. But how can we each strive to protect the environment beyond our habitual habits, like avoiding plastic bags and turning off the lights when we leave a room? How can green living pave the way for reduced climate change and a better environment for future generations?

            <h2>What is the green living?</h2>
            <p>About the <span className='text-success h5'>Nature on Earth</span> by Tree with Animals</p>
            <p><span className='text-success'>Green living</span> is a lifestyle that strives to create balance in preserving and protecting Earth’s natural resources, habitats, human civilization and biodiversity. In short, green living is a means of developing sustainable habits in one’s daily life so that their daily routines work alongside the resources of nature instead of depleting them, or doing more long-term damage to the environment or ecological system. The most common way that people become more cognizant of the vital aspects to green living are through the need to reduce pollution, to protect our wildlife from going extinct, and to preserve our conservation of natural resources. Predominantly, people recognise that green living can alleviate the rapidly increasing rates of climate change and global warming.</p>
            <h3>How to Save the Earth?</h3>
            <p>Many type <span className='text-success h4'>Save Earth</span> by Human do Plantation on His way.</p>
            <p>One of the primary components of green living is to make use of what you already have: i.e., the infamous
                saying of, “reduce, reuse, recycle”.

                Another green living trend that grew in popularity due to the pandemic was gardening.

                More and more people have decided to grow their own produce at home, and doing so helps reduce both food
                faste and superfluous use of plastic packaging. </p>
